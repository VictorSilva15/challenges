# Portfolio - Rocketseat challenge #1

Hello guy, this is a sub repository that keeps the source code of the secod challenge from rocketseat (discover) plataform. Here i built a social tree with ReactJS and styled-components. To create the animations flow I've used the AOS library, that's a simple package that allow us to create animations on scroll. To request github data from the public api, I've used fetch and SWR to keep the data in cache, thus, there's no need to revalidate the data every time. I deployed it in vercel, so if you want to access the page click [here](https://victorsilva15.vercel.app/)
